# Welcome

**Here is my work**. [Blogs](/public)

> Winners embrace hard work. They love the discipline of it, the trade-off they’re making to win. Losers, on the other hand, see it as punishment. And that’s the difference.

## Reasons I Program

* I love the challenges and solving problems.
* Hopfully in time my work will be recognized.
* AI *didn't ruin it*.
* It keeps me very busy.

```
func main(){
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
