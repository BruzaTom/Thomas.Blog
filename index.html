  My name is Thomas Gomez. Thanks for checking out my website! I'm not so sure how common this story is but years after leaving programming and my education, I've decided to return and continue learning and creating within the world of programming. Currently the classes I'm taking are on <a href="https://www.boot.dev/">boot.dev</a> and I am thoroughly enjoying the experience.

  I'm a developer who loves creating useful things. Developing tools is very enjoyable work for me. I tend to be a bit more practical when deciding on a project to work on. I prefer to work on projects that help people or something new to challenge myself. I've worked on many projects but as of the last year have started finishing programs as executables using GUI's. I developed this website to display <a href="index2.html">documentations</a> of my work for potential employers and anyone else who appreciates the content. </pre>

        <h2>What I Love About Programming</h2>
        <pre class="single-scrollable">
  A great way to explain my passion for programming is a summation of all my passions. I love working hard, creating complex things, and challenging myself.

  Like most programmers I of course indulged in video games as a child. From there I took an interest in stop-motion animations using clay figures and Legos to create action scenes, even car chases. From there I moved onto skateboarding. once I went to college I figured id try for programming since I liked video games. While attending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Community_College">Alvin Community College</a>, my classes included microcomputer applications, programming fundamentals, programming fundamentals II, and the accompanying classes in mathematics for each semester. 
        
  Through the short experience of traditional college classes, I learned just how much I loved this stuff. It wasn't about making a game anymore, I became fascinated with the world of computer science. The amazing challenges overcome and the problems solved with programming logic. I did my own research outside of classes and learned of Unix, Dennis Ritchey and ken Thompson. For me that's what sealed the deal. I never got over how I felt about the industry after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0">this documentary.</a>
