I wrote the scripts for this game in <i>C#</i>, the default language for the engine. For a time I spent a lot of time and effort in the game. Between my classes, work and everyday life, I had to put this project on the back burner. Another reason I seldom progress this project is because I'm not at a point where I want to learn 3D asset creation. Im open to team up with an artist who loves creating characters and story lines. I can handle the programming no problem, but the artistry and player animations is its own profession. You can contact me at <i>thomasagomez77@gmail.com</i> where id be happy to discuss a partnership.</blockquote></div>
