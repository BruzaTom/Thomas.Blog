The user must first select a window to focus from a list of active windows. When record is selected the program focuses a window, listens to left and mouse clicks, then adds the clicks and there delta times between to there respective lists. After the sequence is finished the user can press the 'f' key to finish. When the user selects play, the selected window will focus and play the precise clicks at the precise delta time over again and again until either the user presses the 'u' key or 1000 repetition's have been completed.</blockquote></div>
