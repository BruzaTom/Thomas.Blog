## Rpg Game

![rpggif](static/images/rpg/rpg_gif.gif)

> This game was created using [Unitys game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_Technologies). I wrote the scripts for this game in *C#*, the default language for the engine. For a time I spent a lot of time and effort in the game. Between my classes, work and everyday life, I had to put this project on the back burner. Another reason I seldom progress this project is because I'm not at a point where I want to learn 3D asset creation. Im open to team up with an artist who loves creating characters and story lines. I can handle the programming no problem, but the artistry and player animations is its own profession. You can contact me at *thomasagomez77@gmail.com* where id be happy to discuss a partnership.
