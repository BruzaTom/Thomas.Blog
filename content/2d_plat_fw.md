> This project is my enviornment for testing new characters, tiles or features in a 2D plat former using pygame. I really enjoy this project and actually I look at it more as a tool for game dev. In the repo there is actually another program using pygame and its the level editor, named editor.py. The editor is how I can easly change the map or create a new level, add enimies, position the player start, and place collectables in the tile map. Thats right a home brewed coustom tile map editor. The editor can save my creation and outputs the dictionary of the tilemap to a JSON file which is loaded in the main game. This is a pretty good framework for a platformer and pretty performative aswell..
