Today I decided to create a simulation in pygame called [Bouncing Balls.](balls.html) 

I posted a [video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oyrKBz1t34o) that seems to be liked by many! Perhaps ill make more of these simulations.

Added a resource section in blogs, aslo learning alot of css and configuring the website. Hope it looks good! I have to admit I got kind of hung up in the web dev of this site, its actually pretty fun! The generation of this site is still from my static site generator, I just personally edit the home and projects pages for css class use. Im implenting the class cases into my program to run completly from markdown. The nave buttons are already transfered over so thats how im automatically generating them on all the pages.

Really exited to start working on my new website! still trying to see what this css stuff is all about. My static site generator is up and working! (This site is made with python and markdown files..) Now I can create project docs and show my work!
