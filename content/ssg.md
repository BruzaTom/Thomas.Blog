![mirror dog](static/images/ssg/mirrordog_gif.gif)

> Its pretty awesome isnâ€™t it! Believe it or not the website your using is generated from one of my programs! Using *Python* I developed a static site generator that takes a *markdown* file *(much easier to comprehend)* and generates a *HTML* script. This program allows me to generate and edit my own website with [github](https://github.com/BruzaTom) hosting it for free!
