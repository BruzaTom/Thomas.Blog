Before coming back to programming I still had the organizational bug!
I would spend my free time making planners aswell as the papertrail that followed.. Once i started taking classes with <a href="https://www.boot.dev/">boot.dev</a>, I decided take my little hobby and turn it into a project. I must add that my mother was a big insparation for the project, since she was having alot of events to juggle and i wanted to help her get a look at her schedual. <b>The planner I created provides a daily schedual, a look at tomorrows schedual, a look at whats coming up this week, and all events schdualled provided the date exists in roughly 900 years.</b></p><h2>Introduction</h2><h2>Conclusion</h2></div>
